 - In the description to the media file, as well as simply in a text post, spintax is supported, format: `{Text_1|Text_2|Text_3|Text_4}`.

 - Option to create a post with buttons under the post, as well as without buttons.
 - Option to select the number of buttons per post, as well as the number of buttons in a row.
 - When creating buttons, spintax is supported, format: `{Button1|Button2} | {{https|http}://example1.com/|{https|http}://example2.com/}`. Data for generating a button can be sent both as text to the bot and as a text file (to create a large volume of posts).
 - Option to add a random variable to each link in the button in the form of `https://example1.com?jd73hddsk83`.
 - Option to create a link to a message to go to a post in the form: `https://t.me/YourBotName_bot?start=c747ca0a61d46131`.

## T4BT Bot operating mode.
 - In `INLINE` mode - the most promising and effective method.
   * This is your own aka `@postbot`, only with a TG username created by you for your personal project or offer!
   * The main difference from the standard postbot is that it generates not one, but many unique IDs for one post or many created posts.
   * Using text randomization both for the description of the media file and for a simple text post, each message sent using one of the IDs will be unique.
   * The same applies to the media file in the post, i.e. each post sent will have a unique media file identifier.
   * The same will apply to the buttons in the post, i.e. each post will have a unique button, of course, provided that the button is set by spintax. For example: `{Button1|Button2} | {{https|http}://example1.com/|{https|http}://example2.com/|...}` and so on 1-2-5-10 thousand variations separated by a forward slash (`|`).


## In the `regular bot` mode.
   * In this mode, a separate link with a unique ID will be generated for each post to go to the post by clicking on the `/start`    button.
   * The whole process of post uniqueization is identical to that described above.


## To start the bot you will need:
   * Your bot's bot token from `@BotFather`.
   * Telegram ID of the account that will be the bot's admin for managing and creating posts.
